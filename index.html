                    <h2>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY MOST PRECIOUS PERSON I EVER MEET.</h2>
                    <h4>   Happy birthday to my love! On this special day, I want you to know just how much you mean to me. From the moment I laid eyes on you, I knew I wanted to share my life with you. Your happiness is my priority, and I cherish every moment we spend together.  I remember the first time we chatted and our first call like it was yesterday. Those memories are etched in my heart. No matter how shy I am, please know that I miss you deeply when we're apart.  You don’t just bring joy to my life; you light up my world with your smile. I’ll always support your dreams, just as I hope you support mine. I promise to always be there for you, no matter what. I will never forget the day I saw you and decided to make you my life partner. You are my word. I always miss you but never say that to you because of my shyness. I had too many dreams. I never forgot the day we first talked on chat. I never forgot the day in which we called the first time. I never forgot the day on which we met. I know I'm not that much handsome but I always want to see you happy. The happiness that I saw on your face when you were with me. I want to spend my whole life with you. I always overthink I don't know why but I promise I never doubt you. I never forgot the day on which you asked me that you are mine. I'm yours and you are mine. So, here’s to you on your birthday! May this year bring you as much happiness as you bring into my life. I love you now and forever! Enjoy your special day!.</h4>
